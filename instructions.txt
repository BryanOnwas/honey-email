Deliverables
Create 2 emails from start to finish (creative - responsive email, subject line and preview text, segments to target, send time): 1 featuring top honey products and 1 featuring beauty products
We've attached a google drive folder of creative assets, feel free to use the product images on the website as well right-click save as.
Outline a plan to re-engage the unengaged email audience: What automations would you set up? How would you segment the audience? Are there any other plays you would recommend for re-engagement? What does success look like?
This can be as simple as a bulleted list. No need to execute the plan, just create a simple proposal.

Questions to consider:
Campaign theme
How would you go about defining the theme and crafting the narrative for the campaign? Give an example of your narrative + creative vision.
Would your campaign be more emotive or more ROI-focused, or both? How would you go about making that decision?
How would you research the addressable audience of past customers and new customers and go about segmenting that audience (e.g. customers vs. prospects). What lists would you build?
Campaign Lifecycle
What sort of testing strategy would you employ? What would you A/B test?
How would you measure success or reporting?
